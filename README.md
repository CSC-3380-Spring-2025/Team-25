# About Our Software

Describe a little about what the project is about here:	                 
GeauxTracker is a web-based budgeting tool that transforms the tedious process of managing finances into an engaging, collaborative experience. The project focuses on:

Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple users can edit and view budgets simultaneously, ensuring everyone stays updated with the latest financial information.
Gamification: By incorporating a points-based system, badges, challenges, and leaderboards, the tool makes budgeting fun. Users are rewarded for adhering to their plans and face penalties for overspending.
Predictive Financial Tips: Leveraging users’ transaction history, the tool offers personalized advice—like identifying unnecessary subscriptions—to help optimize spending.
Built with modern web technologies such as Next.js, React, ShareDB, ExpressJS, and FastAPI, Budget Tracker streamlines budget management and keeps users motivated with interactive, game-like elements.
